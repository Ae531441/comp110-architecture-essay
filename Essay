\subtitle{COMP110 - Computer Architecture Essay}

\author{Angus Edwards}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section*{Topic}

My essay will be on
% Uncomment as appropriate:
   convexity-based collision detection for a 2D game engine.
%   procedural level generation for a 2D platform game.

\section*{Paper 1}
% This is an example! Replace the details with a paper relevant to your chosen topic.

\item[Title:] Real-time collision detection
\item[Citation:] \cite{Ericson, Christer}
\item[Full text link:] \url{https://q3k.org/gentoomen/Game%20Development/Programming/Real-Time%20Collision%20Detection.pdf}
\item[Comments:] One of the most cited and well established articles on collision detection, it's particularly thorough and would be a good choice for one of the 3 articles to review.

\section*{Paper 2}
\begin{description}
\item[Title:] Collision detection and avoidance in computer controlled manipulators
\item[Citation:] \cite{Udupa, Shriram Mahabal}
\item[Full text link:] http://ijcai.org/Past%20Proceedings/IJCAI-77-VOL2/PDF/041.pdf
\item[Comments:] Interesting article on collisions but based on computer science more than 2D gaming unfortunately.

\item[Title:] Game engine architecture
\item[Citation:] \cite{gregory2009game}
\item[Full text link:] http://forum.dronprogs.org/files_for_my_posts/books/GEA.pdf
\item[Comments:] Very in depth analysis of collision detection even with some links and comparisons to changes from 2D to 3D, generally has a lot of information and well cited.

\item[Citation:] \cite{liu2008convex}
\item[Full text link:] https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~haoz/pubs/liu_zhang_gi08.pdf
\item[Comments:] Slightly different take on collision detection, a lot of useful diagrams and maths that approach the subject differently from the other papers.
